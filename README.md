1. Scatter Plot

Source Dataset : ROC-wise Statement showing the statistics of prosecutions for the year 2013-14

Link : https://data.gov.in/catalog/roc-wise-statistics-prosecutions

Plot Utility : Compares the No. of outstanding cases at the start of the financial year 2013-2014 to the No. of cases pending at the end of the financial year 2013-2014

Observation : Most of the points conform closely to the slope 1 line, showing that the number of cases resolved were almost equal to the number of new cases submitted. Although there is one outlier; in Bihar ROC, a much larger number of cases were resolved than the new ones.


2. Box Plot

Source Dataset : Foreign Tourist Arrivals in India from Top 15 Source Countries from 2001 to 2015

Link : https://data.gov.in/resources/foreign-tourist-arrivals-india-top-15-source-countries-2001-2015

Plot Utility : Shows the general pattern for the number of tourists coming to India from foreign countries during the period of 2001-2015.

Observation : Since there was a lot of data, a box plot was the appropriate choice. It can be seen that the general trend is that the number of tourists have been increasing steadily. Although there are some outliers, except for them, the data is almost consistent. These outliers are the countries USA, UK and Bangladesh in almost all of the cases.


3. Bar Plot

Source Dataset : Economic- Activity wise Active Government Companies as on 31st March, 2014

Link : https://data.gov.in/resources/economic-activity-wise-active-government-companies-31st-march-2014

Plot Utility : Shows the total number of companies in each of tthe major economic sector(Minor heads been grouped into one)

Observation : A fairly high number of companies fall under the Industry and Services sectors, this can be attributed to the fact that these sectors have a fairly large number of subheads and most of them are still rapidly growing due to which there is a large number of government companies investing in them. Also, Agriculture sector shows a very less number of government companies.
